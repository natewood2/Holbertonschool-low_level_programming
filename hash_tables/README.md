Imagine a hash table as a big set of drawers, where each drawer can hold information. When you want to store something, like a phone number, you need to decide which drawer to put it in. This is where a special formula, called a hash function, comes in. You use this formula on the thing you're storing (like a person's name) and it tells you which drawer to use.

But sometimes, this formula might tell you to put two different things in the same drawer. This is called a collision. To solve this, you can do a couple of things. One way is to make each drawer a small box where you can store multiple items. Another way is to find another empty drawer and put your item there.

As you put more and more items in your drawers, they start to get full. If they get too full, it takes longer to find things. So, when this happens, you might decide to get a bigger set of drawers and rearrange everything. This is like resizing the hash table.

In summary, a hash table is a smart way to store and find information quickly. It's like having a well-organized set of drawers with a special method to know where everything goes. This makes it super quick to find what you need later!:wq
